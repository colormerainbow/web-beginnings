        <h2>Objects of Scientific Interest</h2>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>President George W. Bush established the monument under the authority of the Antiquities Act of 1906, which
            protects places of historic or scientific significance. Only recently have scientists visited the realm of
            the monument, observing previously unknown biological, chemical, and geological wonders of nature.
        </p>
        <h3>Mariana Trench Geology</h3>
        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench">The Mariana Trench </a> is the deepest place on Earth,
            deeper than the height of Mount Everest above sea level. It is five times longer than the Grand Canyon and
            includes some 50,532,102 acres that are virtually unknown to humans. </p>

        <section class="showcase">
            <h3>The Volcanic Unit</h3>
            <p>An arc of undersea mud volcanoes and thermal vents – supports unusual life forms in some of the harshest
                conditions imaginable. Here species survive in the midst of hydrothermal vents that produce highly
                acidic and boiling water. </p>

            <h3>The Champagne vent</h3>
            <p>Found at the NW Eifuku volcano, produces almost pure liquid carbon dioxide, one of only two known sites
                in the world. A pool of liquid sulfur at the Daikoku submarine volcano is unique in all the world. The
                only other known location of molten sulfur is on Io, a moon of the planet of Jupiter.</p>

            <h3>Extreme Lifeforms!</h3>
            <p>Extreme pressure and heat, toxic levels of dissolved metals and gases, and extreme reducing conditions
                are found across various Monument features. In spite of these conditions life not only exists, but
                thrives; albeit in forms that are uniquely suited for these specific locations. </p>

        <h2>Ecosystem in the Islands Unit</h2>

        <div class="showcase">
            <p>
                In the Islands Unit, unique reef habitats support marine biological communities dependent on basalt rock
                foundations, unlike those throughout the remainder of the Pacific. These reefs and waters are among the
                most biologically diverse in the Western Pacific and include the greatest
                diversity of seamount and hydrothermal vent life yet discovered. They also contain one of the most
                diverse collections of stony corals in the Western Pacific, including more than 300 species, higher than
                any other U.S. reef area.

        <div class="showcase2">
            <p>The submerged caldera at Maug is one of only a few known places in the world where photosynthetic and
                chemosynthetic communities of life co-exist. The caldera is some 1.5 miles wide and 820 feet deep, an
                unusual depth for lagoons. The lava dome in the center of the crater rises to within 65 feet of the
                surface. Hydrothermal vents at about 475 feet in depth along the northeast side of the dome spew acidic
                water at scalding temperatures near the coral reef that quickly ascends to the sea surface. Thus, coral
                reefs and microbial mats are spared much of the impact of these plumes and are growing nearby, complete
                with thriving tropical fish. As ocean acidification increases across the Earth, this caldera offers
                scientists an opportunity to look into the future and ensure continuation of coral reef communities.</p>

                    Venting fluids were measured at 217°F (103°C); the surrounding water temperature was 36°F (2°C).

        <div class="showcase">
            <p>The coral reef ecosystems within the Islands Unit have high numbers of apex predators, larger than
                anywhere else along the Mariana Archipelago. One site has the highest density of sharks anywhere in the
                Pacific, even higher than those of the remote islands of the Central Pacific.</p>

            <p>Similarly, these northern islands have the highest large fish biomass in the Mariana Islands. The rare
                bumphead parrotfish – the largest parrotfish species – thrives in these waters. The species has been
                depleted throughout much of its range and is included on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.</p>

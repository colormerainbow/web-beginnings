                protects approximately 95,216 square miles of submerged lands and waters. This unique place on Earth
                includes three units: </p>

                <h3>The Islands Unit</h3>
                <p>The waters and submerged lands of the three northernmost Mariana Islands.</p>

                    States in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) to the southern limit of the

            <h3>MANAGEMENT &amp; ADVISORY GROUPS</h3>

            <p>No waters are included in the Volcanic and Trench Units, and CNMI maintains all authority for managing
                the
                three islands within the Islands Unit (Farallon de Pajaros or Uracas, Maug, and Asuncion) above the mean
                low
                water line. </p>

            <p>Presidential Proclamation 8335 established the monument in January 2009 and assigned management
                responsibility to the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce. The
                Interior Secretary placed the Mariana Trench and Volcanic Units within the National Wildlife Refuge
                System,
                and delegated his management responsibility to the Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>

            <p>The Secretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has
                primary
                management responsibility for fishery related activities in the waters of the Islands Unit. </p>

            <p>The Secretaries have established a Mariana Trench Monument Advisory Council to provide advice and
                recommendations on the development of management plans and management of the monument. The Council
                currently
                includes three officials of the CNMI government and one representative each from the Department of
                Defense
                and the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>

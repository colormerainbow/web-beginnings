        <h2>Wildlife &amp; Habitat</h2>

        <h3>Wildlife</h3>
        <p>There are many species of whales and dolphins found in the Islands Unit of the Monument. Some of these
            species are year-round residents of the Mariana archipelago, while others are seasonal visitors or merely
            transit through the area.</p>

        <section class="showcase">
            <h3>Unique Habitat</h3>
            <p> The researchers spotted the life forms at depths up to 6.6 miles within the Sirena Deep of the Mariana
                Trench National Wildlife Refuge. Recent studies indicate that by trapping particles from the water,
                xenophyophores can concentrate high levels of lead, uranium and mercury and are thus likely highly
                resistant to large doses of heavy metals. They are well suited to a life of darkness, low temperature
                and high pressure in the deep sea.
